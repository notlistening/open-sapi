Features:

Dumb Client Closes after long timeout of waiting for close from Server

Simple monitoring client that checks resposiveness and take actions
    * Loaded at Server Launch
    * Expects a 200 OK response
    * Takes action on other responses (Might require a Server on a thread or actions that block on the thread)
    * No response restart Server - killall for both client and Server kill client when server is responsive again
    * Hold server back until monitoring client has connected and given a GO
    * Audio feedback of restart
    * Possible monitoring and restart of SpeechD
    * On Correct Server close exit monitor
    
Client must implement global & transaction timeouts

Sever must reply to client with meaningful information




Smart Server generates timeouts based on the task and closes the client if  the
server begins fails.

Hand over monitoring to another thread

Senario 1

Can not communicate with client
    * Server - force close socket
    * Rely on client timeout?

Server unresponsive - event loop is frozen
    * Setup thread to connect into server to ping to check for reponsiveness
    * If the server is unresponsive then kiil the server and restart. check for
      new server then exit thread
      
Wine stops running
    * Client should monitor in this senario
    * Does the monitoring thread become unresponsive?
