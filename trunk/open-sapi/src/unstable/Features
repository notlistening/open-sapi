Ideas:

Client Closes after long timeout of waiting for reply from Server .............. Done
Client must implement global & transaction timeouts ............................ Started
    The Global Array for Event Tracking should be unset at some point

Client should report to the user why it has timed out .......................... Started
    Implementation of Global Multi Dimentional Array for Data Sharing
    This will free the return Status 
Sever and Client must co-operate when closing sockets .......................... Started

Impl

Server and Client should Log to one file using the standard log file format

Simple monitoring client that checks resposiveness and take actions pn the server
    * Loaded at Server Launch
    * Expects a 200 OK response
    * Takes action on other responses (Might require a Server on a thread or actions that block on the thread)
    * No response restart Server - killall for both client and Server kill client when server is responsive again
    * Hold server back until monitoring client has connected and given a GO
    * Audio feedback of restart
    * Possible monitoring and restart of SpeechD
    * On Correct Server close exit monitor
    


Sever must reply to client with meaningful information ie what fails or suceeds

Smart Server generates timeouts based on the task and closes the client if  the
server begin fails. Should stop SD from freezing the desktop


Senario 1

Can not communicate with client
    * Server - force close socket
    * Rely on client timeout?

Server unresponsive - event loop is frozen
    * Setup thread to connect into server to ping to check for reponsiveness
    * If the server is unresponsive then kiil the server and restart. check for
      new server then exit thread
      
Wine stops running
    * Client should monitor in this senario
    * Does the monitoring thread become unresponsive?
