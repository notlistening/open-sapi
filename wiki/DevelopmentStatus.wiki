#summary The current status of each componemt with detail on the work still outstanding.
=Status:=
Currently we have:

   * SAPI 5.1 - A much smaller Text to speech installer has been found online that gives the basic three free English MS voices. This has been extracted and will now install without user interaction. A work around for the problem with WINE had been identified but now yet implemented. Lastly there is the need to create an installation script that will install the software correctly.  

   * Middleware - The server is completed to the level that I required for the first release. Basic speech can be generated with uptu

   * Ubuntu 8.10 - Tested and seems to work fine with PulseAudio, not sure about performance issues with the current PulseAudio implementation.  

   * Speech Dispatcher - Starting work on a generic Speech Dispatcher driver for use through the command line interface.
