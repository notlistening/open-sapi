=Current Status:=
Currently the project is not available for download, as and when further progress is made to make the installtion easy and straight forward will there be an official release. 
=Done=
   * SAPI 5.1 - A much smaller Text to speech installer has been found online that gives the basic three free English MS voices. This has been extracted and will now install without user interaction. A work around for the problem with WINE had been identified but now yet implemented. Lastly there is the need to create an installation script that will install the software correctly.  

   * Middleware - The server is completed to the level that I required for the first release. Basic speech can be generated for a single client.

   * Ubuntu 8.10 - Tested and seems to work fine with PulseAudio, performance seems on a par if not better than the espeak synthesiser. 

   * Speech Dispatcher - In part the Generic configuration is implemented enough to get Orca speaking.
