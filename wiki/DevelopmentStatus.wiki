=Current Status:=
Currently the project is only available for download through svn see   	 DeveloperEnvironment for details of how to do this. We are someway off making a public release of the porject but keep watching. 
=Done=
   * SAPI 5.1 - A much smaller Text to speech installer has been found online that gives the basic three free English MS voices. This has been extracted and will now install without user interaction. A work around for the problem with WINE had been implemented. 

   * Middleware - The server is and client are functioning and are semi reliable. Improvements to the performance need to be investigated.

   * Ubuntu 8.10 - The PulseAudio version in 8.10 randomly segfault at the moment and requires a ctrl-alt-del to reset, performance is poor at the moment and freezes the gui while synthesis takes place. 

   * Speech Dispatcher - A bug appears when your are speaking a line with a full stop in the middle. The client to speechD interactuon is not quite right.
