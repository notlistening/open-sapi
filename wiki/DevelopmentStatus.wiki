=Current Status:=
Currently the project is only available for download through svn, as and when further progress is made to make the installtion easy and straight forward will there be an official release. 
=Done=
   * SAPI 5.1 - A much smaller Text to speech installer has been found online that gives the basic three free English MS voices. This has been extracted and will now install without user interaction. A work around for the problem with WINE had been implemented. 

   * Middleware - The server is completed to the level that I required for the first release. Basic speech can be generated for a single client.

   * Ubuntu 8.10 - The PulseAudio version in 8.10 randomly segfault at the moment and requires a ctrl-alt-del to reset, performance is poor at the moment and freezes the gui while synthesis takes place. 

   * Speech Dispatcher - A bug appears when your are speaking a line with a full stop in the middle. The client to speechD interactuon is not quite right.
